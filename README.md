# Machine Learning Models & Digit Recognition

This repository contains a collection of machine learning model and scripts, specifically focused on image processing and digit recognition tasks using neural networks.

The script counts the occurrence of each decimal digit (0-9) in the provided image archive and output a 10-element array: [0_count, 1_count, 2_count, 3_count, 4_count, 5_count, 6_count, 7_count, 8_count, 9_count].
